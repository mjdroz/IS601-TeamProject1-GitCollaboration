# Git Remote Command 

* The git remote command is designed for creating, viewing and removing connections to other repositories. Remote connections are considered to be bookmarks in other repositories, which are convenient names used for referencing URL that are not convenient enough.

* The diagram below displays two remote connections from your repository into the central repository and into the repository of another developer. You can pass the origin to another developer and they will shortcut to other Git commands. As a result, you wonâ€™t have to reference the connections by their full URLs.

# Remote Add

* To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
* The git remote add command takes two arguments:
	* A remote name, for exmaple, origin
	* A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git


# Remote Remove
* The git remote rm command has one parameter: The existing remote name;
* The example will remove the gitlab remote. Note that the command will not delete the repository, just the local reference.
* C:\Users\adm\repos\jersey-hello-world>git remote rm gitlab 
* To check that the remote was removed run the following command:
* C:\Users\adm\repos\jersey-hello-world>git remote -v
* github https://github.com/admfactory/jersey-hello-world.git (fetch)
* github https://github.com/admfactory/jersey-hello-world.git (push)


# Remote Show
